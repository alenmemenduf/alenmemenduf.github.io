<p>Me and my friend, Cristian Rosiu, joined Brackeys 2020.2 Game Jam. We had 7 days to come up with a game that fits the theme "Rewind". </p><br>
<p>I've worked on the overall look of the game, shaders are mostly done by me also. I worked on the movement, the procedural generation of the level, the game design and QA. I also made that disco ball "rewind" on click and I find it cool. </p><br>
<p>We managed to score top 18% out of 1858 entries, the overall score was 3.5/5 and was rated by 28 people.</p>
