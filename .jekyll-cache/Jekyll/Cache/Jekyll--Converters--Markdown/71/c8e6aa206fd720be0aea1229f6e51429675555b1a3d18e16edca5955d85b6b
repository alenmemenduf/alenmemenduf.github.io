I"*<p>The first Game Jam I participated in. It was a romanian game jam named "jamdecasa", it was 3-days long and the theme was "You only have 5 minutes!", so we made a 2D platformer in Unity. We were one of the 72 teams that raised 40.710 RON, donated to a charity that buys assets for hospitals.</p>
